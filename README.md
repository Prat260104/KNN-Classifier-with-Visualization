# 🧠 K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier with Visualization

This project implements a complete machine learning pipeline using the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm. It includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and insightful data visualizations using Python libraries such as `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `scikit-learn`.

## 📁 Dataset

- The dataset is loaded from a CSV file provided by the user at runtime.
- Missing values are handled by replacing them with column means.
- Features and target are automatically extracted (last column assumed to be target).
